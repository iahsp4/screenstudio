ScreenStudio will use the power of avconv to let your create a screencast of your desktop, with your webcam and a banner in overlay

It is built around "avconv" that is currently available on all Linux distos and should work "out-of-the-box". There are no dependencies beside the need for the JRE 6.0 (OpenJDK) and Libav-Tools 9.x. and libJNA (provided with the archive)
